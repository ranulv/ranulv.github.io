summary: "This study investigates the development of a robotic walker for gait rehabilitation that integrates social assistive robotics and principles of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), a form of music therapy. The robotic system is intended to supplement, rather than replace, the work of professional music therapists by enabling therapeutic interventions to continue outside of therapy sessions. Robot-facilitated Music Therapy is an evolutionary step of telerehabilitation, providing patients with greater autonomy while still benefiting from the expertise and guidance of therapists. Contributions of the research include 1) Robot-facilitated Music Therapy through a robotic walker as a platform for gait rehabilitation. 2) Remote Music Therapy through a robotic walker as a telerehabilitation platform for music therapists to remotely monitor and consult with patients. 3) Intelligent companionship integrated with a robotic walker for comprehensive user assistance. The proposed system, tested for its functionalities including personified RAS, social interaction, user monitoring, mobility control, and emergency response yielded promising results for real-world application."

##### Abstract

Microgrippers, devices based on MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology, are widely used to manipulate biological samples. When used for biomanipulation, they often confront the problem of stiction of samples to gripping jaws due to the behavior of materials at the microscale. The proposed design integrates a gripper with an active release mechanism that involves a compliant bistable mechanism enabling a quicker release that is conventionally difficult for electrothermal microgrippers. The proposed design features cascaded and double V-shaped thermoelectric actuators for effective micromanipulation. Along with selecting a suitable material for the microgrippers, a fabrication process has also been proposed. Simulation and analysis conducted using the COMSOL Multiphysics software have demonstrated operating temperatures and displacements in the preferable range for biomanipulation.
