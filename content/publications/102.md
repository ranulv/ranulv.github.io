summary: "This study investigates the development of a robotic walker for gait rehabilitation that integrates social assistive robotics and principles of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), a form of music therapy. The robotic system is intended to supplement, rather than replace, the work of professional music therapists by enabling therapeutic interventions to continue outside of therapy sessions. Robot-facilitated Music Therapy is an evolutionary step of telerehabilitation, providing patients with greater autonomy while still benefiting from the expertise and guidance of therapists. Contributions of the research include 1) Robot-facilitated Music Therapy through a robotic walker as a platform for gait rehabilitation. 2) Remote Music Therapy through a robotic walker as a telerehabilitation platform for music therapists to remotely monitor and consult with patients. 3) Intelligent companionship integrated with a robotic walker for comprehensive user assistance. The proposed system, tested for its functionalities including personified RAS, social interaction, user monitoring, mobility control, and emergency response yielded promising results for real-world application."

##### Abstract

A novel approach for autonomous summoning of Patient Assistive Mobile Robots (PAMRs) to improve their use in areas with limited infrastructure and healthcare access has been presented. The method has been designed to operate effectively in unstructured environments, eliminating the need for Wi-Fi or other network-dependent Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). The proposed summoning approach integrates LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Sound Source Localization, and Stereo Vision technologies. For scenarios where the patient is not within the robotâ€™s line of sight, Sound Source Localization guides the robot toward auditory cues. The system utilizes stereo-vision-based gesture recognition and depth estimation for line-of-sight scenarios, allowing patients to summon the robot using natural gestures. LiDAR-based SLAM has been utilized for mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. This multimodal approach ensures the robustness of the summoning capabilities, making it adaptable to diverse environments. Preliminary testing has demonstrated the method's effectiveness, suggesting potential incorporation in PAMRs for healthcare delivery.
