summary: "Robotic walkers have emerged as an innovative technology in the field of assistive devices, offering enhanced mobility and independence to individuals with physical limitations.

A key safety feature of the walker is its obstacle avoidance system which utilizes haptic feedback to alert users of obstacles in their path. The haptic feedback interface has been developed to indicate both the direction and the proximity of any detected obstacles.

##### Abstract

Robotic walkers have emerged as an innovative technology in the field of assistive devices, offering enhanced mobility and independence to individuals with physical limitations. In this paper, an intelligent control system for a robotic walker designed to actively guide users using cost-effective force-sensitive resistors has been proposed. The control interface provides a responsive and intuitive user experience. To achieve the desired smoothness and sensitivity of control, a rule-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is implemented. A key safety feature of the walker is its obstacle avoidance system which utilizes haptic feedback to alert users of obstacles in their path. The haptic feedback interface has been developed to indicate both the direction and the proximity of any detected obstacles. The system was tested in a controlled environment with three healthy subjects. and the results demonstrated a satisfactory level of convergence between the user’s intended path and the actual path taken by the walker. The haptic feedback system received predominantly positive responses, although some areas for improvement were identified. Future work will focus on enhancing the system’s adaptivity to accommodate different pathological conditions.
