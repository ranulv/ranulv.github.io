summary: "This work presents a Remote Monitoring Robot for Gait Rehabilitation, adopting a patient-centered approach to robot-assisted gait training while empowering remote clinical oversight. Our system integrates two key elements: 1) Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation employs music and rhythm to enhance gait patterns in individuals with gait disorders, aligning with physiotherapy objectives. 2) Remote Gait Monitoring utilizes wearable IMUs for real-time gait data transmission to medical professionals. This enables informed remote care delivery and reduces the necessity for frequent in-person consultations.  Crucially, the system provides direct feedback to the user for gait improvement, enabling self-guided training even in the absence of external monitoring."

##### Abstract

This work presents a Remote Monitoring Robot for Gait Rehabilitation, adopting a patient-centered approach to robot-assisted gait training while empowering remote clinical oversight. Our system integrates two key elements: 1) Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation employs music and rhythm to enhance gait patterns in individuals with gait disorders, aligning with physiotherapy objectives. 2) Remote Gait Monitoring utilizes wearable IMUs for real-time gait data transmission to medical professionals. This enables informed remote care delivery and reduces the necessity for frequent in-person consultations.  Crucially, the system provides direct feedback to the user for gait improvement, enabling self-guided training even in the absence of external monitoring.

##### Functionalities

+ Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation: Using music and rhythm to improve users with gait disorders and to potentially
support physiotherapy goals.
+ Remote Gait Monitoring: Employing wearable IMUs, a solution is designed for medical professionals to remotely track real-time gait data, facilitating informed care and reducing the need for frequent in-person visits.
+ Provides feedback for gait improvement to the user even without external monitoring
