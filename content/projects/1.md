summary: "This paper proposes a matching model of the labor market with job rationing: unemployment does not disappear in the absence of matching frictions. In recessions, job rationing drives the rise of unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to it."

##### Abstract

This novel microgripper design utilizes electrothermal actuators, specifically U-shaped and V-shaped configurations, to achieve controlled grasping and releasing actions. After the literature review on thermoelectrically actuated microgrippers and release mechanisms the need for microgrippers capable of delicately manipulating objects, particularly in biomedical research was recognized. 

Traditional thermally actuated microgrippers often struggle with releasing grasped objects, prompting the incorporation of an active release mechanism. This mechanism enables controlled release without external forces, crucial for preserving the integrity of delicate samples.

The design leverages electrothermal actuators, offering simplicity, ease of fabrication, and compatibility with various heat sources. Fabrication utilizes SU-8 biocompatible polymer and gold layers, ensuring mechanical stability, thermal efficiency, and compatibility with biological applications. Results from simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the microgripper, with minimal out-of-plane displacement and favorable temperatures for biological manipulation.

Overall, this project contributes to the advancement of microgripper technology, offering a versatile tool for biomedical research and other microscale applications.
