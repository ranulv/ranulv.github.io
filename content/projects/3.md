summary: "This project presents an autonomous walker designed for individuals with mobility limitations. It utilizes a navigation stack built on Robot Operating System (ROS) for self-directed movement guided by user-specified goals through a multimodal interface combining LiDAR, sound source localization, and computer vision. Additionally, the walker offers a mechanism for sit-to-stand mobility assistance and provides active user guidance through an array of force-sensing resistors. We successfully implemented and configured the ROS stack, fabricated a functional prototype, and conducted structural analysis. Future work focuses on fine-tuned navigation, user studies, and clinical trials to evaluate the system's potential for real-world application, promoting independence and mobility for users."

##### Abstract

This project presents an autonomous walker designed for individuals with mobility limitations. It utilizes a navigation stack built on Robot Operating System (ROS) for self-directed movement guided by user-specified goals through a multimodal interface combining LiDAR, sound source localization, and computer vision. Additionally, the walker offers a mechanism for sit-to-stand mobility assistance and provides active user guidance through an array of force-sensing resistors. We successfully implemented and configured the ROS stack, fabricated a functional prototype, and conducted structural analysis. Future work focuses on fine-tuned navigation, user studies, and clinical trials to evaluate the system's potential for real-world application, promoting independence and mobility for users.

##### Functionalities

+ Autonomous User Localization: By successfully integrating LiDAR, sound, and visual sensory data a system
that eliminates the reliance on Indoor Positioning Systems is developed to enable the walker to autonomously
navigate to the user.
+ Active Walking Guidance: Guides the user to avoid obstacles when using the walker while adapting to the userâ€™s
pace by incorporating force-sensitive resistors which provide an intuitive control interface. The system can identify emergency user states and mitigate fall risks. 
+ Sit-to-stand assistance: Using a mechanism to provide standing support upon estimation of user height through human pose estimation.
+ Onboard Gait Analysis: Employing a walker-mounted 2D LiDAR, gait analysis is enabled, potentially providing
diagnostic data for gait assessment.
